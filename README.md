# Tatari Engineering Coding Exercises

### Welcome!

[Tatari](https://www.tatari.tv) is a data and analytics company focused on buying and measuring ads across traditional and streaming TV. We have turned TV advertising into a digital-like experience: measured, real-time, and with the ability to manage advertising campaigns in small or big doses.

Our team includes founders or leaders at other fast-rising companies, like Shazam, TrueCar, Crunchyroll, Vizify, LiveRail, LKQD as well as more established large companies like Google, Facebook, and Yahoo. We are not comprised of agency folks — most of us are engineers and data scientists by training, and we’re focused on building technology that helps us operate leaner and faster — giving our clients a competitive edge.

[Tatari](https://www.tatari.tv/about-us) is always hiring for smart Backend, Frontend, Data, and DevOps engineers.

[Check out our current job postings](https://www.tatari.tv/careers).

We have offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, and New York City. 

We are also open to remote positions for the right people.

Thanks!
